	<!-- Method = procedure we can run "on" something -->
var arr = [];

	example: push appends element to end of array,
	arr.push(3)
	pop removed an element from the end
	var a = arr.pop()
	while (arr.length > 0) {
		console.log(arr.pop())  <--- pop good for backwards hello, push into another array.
	}


	splice (destructive) and slice (nondestructive)

	slice two values, (index, index), e.g. (1,4)
	from start, up to but not including 4

	var mid = arr4.slice(1,4);
	console.log(mid); 

	arr.slice(3, arr.length);

	splice removes elements from middle
	arr5 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

	arr5.splice(start, howMany)
	var p = arr5.splice(4,1) will take out "e" and store it in p

	JOIN and SPLIT

	join turns and array into a string
	split turns a string into an array
	split on ("") will get each character in a string.
